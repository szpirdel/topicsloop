## 📝 Notes

### Development Philosophy
- **MVP First:** Ship working features, iterate based on feedback
- **AI Transparency:** Always explain AI decisions to users
- **Performance:** Keep UX snappy even with large datasets
- **Documentation:** Code should be self-documenting + comprehensive docs

### Prioritization Criteria
1. **User Value:** Does it solve a real problem?
2. **Effort:** Can we build it efficiently?
3. **Dependencies:** Does it block other features?
4. **Technical Debt:** Does it improve code quality?
