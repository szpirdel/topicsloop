‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Before creating, modifying, or deleting any .md files:

1. **Always ask for approval first**

3. **Consider if the content fits into existing documents**
4. **Avoid creating new files without explicit agreement**

This policy prevents documentation sprawl and maintains a clean, organized structure.
